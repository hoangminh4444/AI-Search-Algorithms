# AI-Search-Algorithms
Implemented different search algorithms in AI, including A*, Bidirectional A*, and MM which would solve pathfinding problems on video game maps; Visualized and compared the differences in solution cost, node expansion and running time between algorithms that use heuristic function and those that do not use
